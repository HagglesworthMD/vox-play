# Phase 7 Pilot Findings

No semantic misunderstandings, misuse signals, or governance concerns were observed during Phase 7 pilot evaluation.

Evaluation focused on operator understanding, language usage, audit interpretation, and governance framing.

**No corrective action required.**

## Summary

| Area | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Operator Understanding | ✅ PASS |
| Workflow Comprehension | ✅ PASS |

## Key Observations

* Copy-out boundary is clearly understood
* "Keep" and "mask" terminology used correctly
* No recoverability expectations
* Acceptance gate is unambiguous
* Audit artefacts are governance-focused, not clinical
* Responsibility boundary (operator vs tool) is clear

---

## Outcome

**Proceed to broader internal evaluation.**

---

## Post-Evaluation Constraints

After this evaluation, the following must NOT change without a new phase:

* UI terminology (Keep/Mask)
* Warning language
* Acceptance gate behaviour
* Audit artefact structure

Any such change requires a new evaluation cycle.
